## About Us üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We are a community of developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts committed to fostering innovation and making life easy for business and product owners. 
Our goal is to create impact through tech by developing and/or enhancing tools needed by business owners to make the day-to-day running of their businesses smooth, and empowering and supporting developers.

## Our Mission

At DWM, we believe in the power of communication, collaboration and teamwork. Our mission is to:

- **Empower Developers**: We provide resources, tools, and support to help developers grow and succeed.
- **Foster Innovation**: We encourage creativity and experimentation, supporting projects that push the boundaries of technology.

## Projects üë©‚Äçüíª

Here are some of the key projects we are working on:

- **Ecomie**: The ecomie application. It has two repositories
  - ecomie-api
  - ecomie-web 


## Contribution Guidelines üåà

### **General Guide**

We welcome contributions from everyone! Here‚Äôs how you can get involved:

1. **Fork the repository**: Create your own copy of our project.
2. **Make your changes**: Improve the project by adding new features, fixing bugs, or updating documentation.
3. **Submit a pull request**: Share your changes with us for review.

### **Issue Code**
Each issue has an ID and status  
For development purposes, we attribute a code to the issue called **Issue Code**. The code combines the project code and the issue ID separated by the letter (t/T) and hyphens (-).

Issue codes are used when creating branches and also when committing our changes. In branches, they are in small letters while in commits they are capitalized.  

For example consider the ecomie project, it has **ec** as project code. Assuming we have an issue with id **36** then in a branch about that issue the Issue Code would look like this
**ec-t-36** while in a commit message it would look like **EC-T-36**.
Check repository README to get Project Code.
   
### **Contribution Practices**

#### Setting up
1. If you have not yet cloned the repository, clone it
   ```
   git clone <url-of-repo>
   ```
2. If have cloned it already checkout the main branch and pull the latest changes.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
3. Create a new branch following the format _[project-code]-t-[issue-id]-[3-to-5-words-describing-the-task]_ eg _ec-t-36-create-all-atoms_
   ```
   git checkout -b ec-t-36-create-all-atoms
   ```
   In the above example **ec** is the project-code, **36** is the issue-id and **create-all-atoms** is the issue's brief description. 
   

#### Committing your changes
1. Add your changes to the staging area to track your changes by running the **git add** command eg to add all modified files run
   ```
   git add .
   ``` 
2. Commit your changes by running the **git commit** command. Your commit message must follow the format EC-T-[issue-number] | Actual message e.g. _git commit -m "EC-T-36 | Created all buttons"_
   ```
   git commit -m "EC-T-36 | Created all buttons"
   ```

#### When you have completed a task
1. Push your changes to remote by running the git push command
   ```
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```
2. Go to GitHub and make a Pull Request (PR) to main. 
3. Request review
